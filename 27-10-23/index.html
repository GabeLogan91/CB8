            <h2>High CBD Strains</h2>
            <p>
              Cannabis geneticists can create strains that are particularly high
              in CBD, with or without the THC. As the CBD market becomes more
              sophisticated, some flower on the market is now over 20%
              Cannabidiol (CBD). These strains can be purchased as CBD
              cigarettes, prerolls or in a jar for “self service.” However, CBD
              vape manufacturers such as TribeTokes also sell these strains in
              CBD vape oil form. In this article, we’ll explore the top rated
              high CBD strains on the market so you can decide which is best for
              you!
